## Medium-clone

Medium clone is a blogging system, build with sanity CMS, next.JS (a React framework with advanced server side rendering capabilities) & typescript.

The blog introduces a Wordpress approach, where the blogger can add articles and other bloggers on board, without adding a single piece of code, all using sanity for free.

Sanity is a JS headless CMS that allows developers to focus more on the frontend and utilize their backend using APIS.

The design, UI/UX is mostly inspired by Medium & can be changed to the clients liking at any time.

## Getting started locally

The project can be deployed locally, following this steps

For sanity, create an account and follow the guides given on their site on how to modify the config and .env file.

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx` or `components/...`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
